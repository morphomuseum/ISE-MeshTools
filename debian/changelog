meshtools (1.3.1xenial0) xenial; urgency=medium

  * ISE-MeshTools should now display correctly objects of both very large and small size (the "auto-zoom" and "clipping-plane" related functions have been corrected).
  * Colours should be now correctly saved within .PLY files
  * Users have now the possibility to have access and to edit landmarks coordinates (Saving landmarks into files is not anymore the only way to get access to landmark coordinates).
  * Users can now create new landmarks at specified x,y, and z coordinates (setting landmark using the mouse+keyboard is not anymore the only way to digitize landmarks).

meshtools (1.3trusty0) trusty; urgency=medium

  *  A few corrections have been brought regarding colour display when VBO functions are used (graphic card acceleration).
  *  MeshTools.ini is now located at a user's specific location.
  *  When freshly compiled/installed, MeshTools.ini does not exist and is now created with convenient default values.
  *  Tag colours and labels, as well as object/grid/background colours can now be reinitialized.
  *  The camera can rotate around objects centre of mass (and not only around 0,0,0), which is convenient when users prefer not to modify the original position of an object.
  *  Possibility to automatically adjust landmark display size, depending of the size of the objects currently opened
  *  Project files now include tags/landmarks/flags/curves/orientation labels
